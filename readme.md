## VirusTotal alternatives

Overall strategy:
* Diversify your analysis approach.
* Don't rely on the results from a single tool.
* Run everything with as few privileges as necessary.
* APT investigations must be seperated from commodity malware, otherwise you give malware authors "ideas".
* Treat everything like it could be malicious until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise.
